The resulting metabolic model, iAdipocytes1809, enables mechanistic insights into adipocyte metabolism on a genome-wide level, and can serve as a scaffold for integration of omics data to understand the genotype–phenotype relationship in obese subjects. By integrating human transcriptome and fluxome data, we found an increase in the metabolic activity around androsterone, ganglioside GM2 and degradation products of heparan sulfate and keratan sulfate, and a decrease in mitochondrial metabolic activities in obese subjects compared with lean subjects.

Here we reconstruct a consensus GEM for hepatocytes, which we call iHepatocytes2322, that extends previous models by including an extensive description of lipid metabolism. We build iHepatocytes2322 using Human Metabolic Reaction 2.0 database and proteomics data in Human Protein Atlas, which experimentally validates the incorporated reactions. The reconstruction process enables improved annotation of the proteomics data using the network centric view of iHepatocytes2322.

These data were then used to reconstruct a comprehensive myocyte GEM. Next, we performed a meta-analysis of six studies comparing muscle transcription in T2D versus healthy subjects. Transcriptional changes were mapped on the myocyte GEM, revealing extensive transcriptional regulation in T2D, particularly around pyruvate oxidation, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and tetrahydrofolate metabolism, connected through the down-regulated dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Strikingly, the gene signature underlying this metabolic regulation successfully classifies the disease state of individual samples, suggesting that regulation of these pathways is a ubiquitous feature of myocytes in response to T2D.","condition":"Diabetes Mellitus","reaction_count":5590,"metabolite_count":4448,"gene_count":2419,"files":[{"path":"models/homo_sapiens/curated_models/myocyte/iMyocyte2419-4934cef2be56b22214947b6e2d1b110f.zip","format":"SBML"}],"ref":["25937284"],"maintained":false,"year":"2015"},{"id":"143","gemodelset":{"name":"tissue-specific models","description":"Resolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease.

The metabolism reconstruction was based on annotated genes, physiological and biochemical information. The stoichiometric model includes 819 biochemical conversions and 152 transport reactions, accounting for a total of 971 reactions. Of the reactions in the network, 700 are unique, while the rest are iso-reactions. The network comprises 500 metabolites. A total of 711 open reading frames (ORFs) were included in the model, which corresponds to 13% of the ORFs with assigned function in the S. coelicolor A3(2) genome. In a comparative analysis with the Streptomyces avermitilis genome, we showed that the metabolic genes are highly conserved between these species and therefore the model is suitable for use with other Streptomycetes. Flux balance analysis was applied for studies of the reconstructed metabolic network and to assess its metabolic capabilities for growth and polyketides production. The model predictions of wild-type and mutants' growth on different carbon and nitrogen sources agreed with the experimental data in most cases. We estimated the impact of each reaction knockout on the growth of the in silico strain on 62 carbon sources and two nitrogen sources, thereby identifying the core of the essential reactions.

These models have been thoroughly studied with tools and algorithms such as flux balance analysis, knock-out analysis, gene essentiality, flux coupling analysis, reporter features and industrially-relevant metabolites production (hydrogen, succinate, ethanol). These models will greatly facilitate the development of cyanobacteria as green microbial cell factories.","condition":"Aerobic and anaerobic continuous cultures","reaction_count":956,"metabolite_count":911,"gene_count":811,"files":[{"path":"models/bacteria_models/synechocystis_sp._pcc6803/iSyn811.zip","format":"BioOpt"}],"ref":["21083885","21226012"],"maintained":false,"year":"2011"},{"id":"50","gemodelset":{"name":"personalized genome-scale metabolic models","description":"Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) serve as scaffolds for integration of omics data for understanding the genotype-phenotype relationship.

Typically treatments of these infections can only be done with the glycopeptides antibiotics vancomycin, synercid, and teiocoplanin. Amycolatopsis balhimycina serves as a model strain for glycopeptide production due to its ability to produce the vancomycin-analogue balhimycin. The balhimycin yield obtained by A. balhimycina is, however, low and there is therefore a need to improve balhimycin production by this organism and this may also lead to a wider use of this organism as a model for glycopeptide production. With the objective to improve the knowledge base of this organism, we therefore performed genome-sequencing of A. balhimycina and used these data to reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic model for the organism. We generated an almost complete A. balhimycina genome sequence comprising 10,562,587 base pairs assembled in 2,153 contigs. The high GC-genome (~69%) included 8,585 open reading frames (ORFs). We used our integrative toolbox called SEQTOR for gene annotation, and used annotated genes to reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic network of A. balhimycina. In the model reconstruction we also used biochemical information retrieved from pathway databases, biochemistry textbooks and recent publications. The resulting network contained 583 ORFs as protein encoding genes (7% of the predicted 8,585 ORFs), 407 EC numbers, 647 metabolites and 1,363 metabolic reactions. During the analysis of the metabolic model, linear, quadratic and evolutionary programming problems using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), Minimization Of Metabolic Adjustments (MOMA) and OptGene were applied and phenotypic behavior and improved balhimycin production were simulated. The model showed a good agreement between in silico data and experimental data and also identified key reactions associated with increased balhimycin production. The reconstruction of the genome-scale metabolic model of A. balhimycina serves as a basis for physiological characterization. The model allows a rational design of engineering strategies for increasing balhimycin production in A. balhimycina and glycopeptide production in general.","condition":"Evaluating metabolic capabilities","reaction_count":1363,"metabolite_count":647,"gene_count":583,"files":[{"path":"models/bacteria_models/amycolatopsis_balhimycina/final_AB_model_Bioopt_BioMet.zip","format":"BioOpt"}],"ref":["22252737"],"maintained":false,"year":"2010"},{"id":"60","gemodelset":{"name":"personalized genome-scale metabolic models","description":"Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) serve as scaffolds for integration of omics data for understanding the genotype-phenotype relationship.

Cells were cultivated in chemostats under nitrogen limitation on fructose or glycerol as carbon sources, and cell mass, growth rate, sugar uptake, alginate and CO2 production were monitored. In addition a genome scale metabolic model was constructed and samples were collected for transcriptome analyses. The analyses show that polymer production operates in a close to optimal way with respect to stoichiometric utilization of the carbon source and that the cells increase the uptake of carbon source to compensate for the additional needs following from alginate synthesis. The transcriptome studies show that in the presence of the mucA mutation, the alg operon is upregulated together with genes involved in energy generation, genes on both sides of the succinate node of the TCA cycle and genes encoding ribosomal and other translation-related proteins. Strains expressing a functional MucA protein (no alginate production) synthesize cellular biomass in an inefficient way, apparently due to a cycle that involves oxidation of NADPH without ATP production. The results of this study indicate that the most efficient way of using a mucA mutant as a cell factory for alginate production would be to use non-growing conditions and nitrogen deprivation.","condition":"Evaluating metabolic capabilities metabolic capabilities","reaction_count":1191,"metabolite_count":0,"gene_count":0,"files":[{"path":"models/bacteria_models/pseudomonas_fluorescens/Pflur.zip","format":"Excel"}],"ref":[],"maintained":false,"year":null},{"id":"70","gemodelset":{"name":"personalized genome-scale metabolic models","description":"Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) serve as scaffolds for integration of omics data for understanding the genotype-phenotype relationship.

Finally, one of the identified targets was validated experimentally, and it was confirmed to attenuate growth of the HepG2 cell line.","reference":["24646661"]},"sample":{"organism":"Homo sapiens","organ_system":null,"tissue":"Soft tissue 1","cell_type":"Adipocytes","cell_line":null},"tag":null,"description":null,"condition":"Metabolic state of healthy versus diseased cells","reaction_count":4062,"metabolite_count":3567,"gene_count":1260,"files":[{"path":"models/homo_sapiens/personalized_genome-scale_metabolic_models/soft_tissue_1/soft tissue 1 - adipocytes.zip","format":"SBML"}],"ref":[],"maintained":false,"year":"2014"}]
